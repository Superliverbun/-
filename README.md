During my sophomore year, there was a course called Management Mathematics. The professor encouraged us to use computers for problem-solving, such as using Excel. So, I thought, why not write a program to help me with the calculations? That's how the Management Mathematics Assistant was born.

I used Tkinter to create a simple GUI interface. It can calculate loan repayment amounts for different repayment methods, including quarterly, yearly, and monthly repayments.

This program might help you achieve a passing grade in Management Mathematics, but I can't guarantee you'll definitely pass. o((>Ï‰< ))o
